# IT1244 Teaching Slides
Welcome! This public repository hosts all tutorial materials that I created for the NUS course IT1244: Artificial Intelligence: Technology and Impact for AY25/26 Semester 2. You'll find slides, code, and additional resources used during the live tutorial. You are encouraged to star this repo to stay updated as new tutorial materials will continue to be added throughout the semester.

## About Github 
I understand that many students who take IT1244 are relatively new to coding. Github is an essential tool to learn, especially for anyone pursuing a career in tech or working on collaborative coding projects. Hence, I believe this is a great opportunity for students to gain their first exposure to Github even though it's just the basics.

### Getting Started with Github (For Beginners)
If you've never used Github before, don't worry! Here's what you need to know:

**What is Github?**
Github is a platform where people share and collaborate on code. Think of it as Google Drive, but specifically designed for code and documents.

**How to access these materials:**
1. **View online:** You can simply browse all files directly on this webpage with no account needed!
2. **Download everything:** Click the green "Code" button above, then "Download ZIP" to get all materials at once
3. **Download individual files:** Click on any file, then click the "Download" button or "Raw" and save the page
4. **Star this repo:** Click the "Star" button at the top right to bookmark this repository

## Tutorial Content Overview
Materials will be organized by week and topic following this **rough** outline (subjected to change):

1. **Artificial Intelligence** - Introduction, opportunities, disruptions, Python, NumPy
2. **Searches** - BFS, UCS, DFS, greedy best-first search, A* search, local search
3. **Supervised Learning** - k-nearest neighbours, linear regression, gradient descent, logistic regression
4. **Unsupervised Learning** - K-means clustering
5. **Deep Learning** - Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs
6. **AI Ethics & Society** - Ethics, privacy, fairness, human vs. AI strengths and weaknesses

## File Organization
- Materials are organized as: **Week X Tutorial X - [Topic Name]**
- Each folder contains all materials used during that tutorial session (slides, code, datasets, etc.)

## About Tutorial Slides 
- All tutorial slides will be uploaded as PDFs
- Materials will typically be uploaded within 24 hours after each tutorial
- Some animations (including my favorite gifs) and transitions will be lost during the PDF conversion process, so do expect some differences from the slides presented during the actual tutorial

## Questions & Contact
